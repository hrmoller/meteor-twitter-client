==============

Twitter client package for Meteor

Basically this package is the codebird-js library found at
https://github.com/mynetx/codebird-js
wrapped in a package structure conforming with the meteor.js guidelines.

However it has been necessary to make certain changes in order to make the
library work with meteor.

It is still very much work in progress and anyone should of course to feel free
to contribute, comment or fork this project.

Examples on use might come in near future...
